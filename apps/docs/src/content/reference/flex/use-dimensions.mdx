The hook `useDimensions` can be used to retrieve the _computed_ width and
height of a `<Flex>` or `<Box>` component as
[CurrentWritable](https://threlte.xyz/docs/reference/core/utilities#currentwritable)
stores.

<Tip type="tip">
	The computed width and height is also available as slot props
	on the components [`<Flex>`](/docs/reference/flex/flex) and
	[`<Box>`](/docs/reference/flex/box).
</Tip>

## In a `<Flex>` component

Because there's no viewport to measure, the width and height of a `<Flex>`
component need to be set manually. Nevertheless, the dimensions of the
contents of the `<Flex>` component will be measured after a layout reflow and
can be retrieved using `useDimensions` in a direct child component to
`<Flex>`.

## In a `<Box>` component

By default `@threlte/flex` controls elements position only. In some cases you
may want to control element sizing too. Since `@threlte/flex` has no
information about how the inner content size works, you need to set your
content size manually. You can do this by using `useDimensions` hook in a
direct child component to `<Box>`.

@example

```svelte
<script>
  import { useDimensions } from '@threlte/flex'

  const { width, height } = useDimensions()
</script>

<T.Mesh
  scale.x={$width}
  scale.y={$height}
>
  <T.BoxGeometry />
  <T.MeshBasicMaterial color="red" />
</T.Mesh>
```
