<Tip type="experimental">
  `@threlte/flex` is early in development. It is possible there will be frequent breaking changes
  until it reaches 0.1.0.
</Tip>

Placing content and making layouts in 3D is hard. The flexbox engine
[`Yoga`](https://yogalayout.com/) is a cross-platform layout engine which
implements the flexbox spec. The package `@threlte/flex` provides components to
easily use `Yoga` in Threlte.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @threlte/flex
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

Use the component [`<Flex>`](/docs/reference/flex/flex) to create a flexbox
container. Since there's no viewport to fill, you must specify the size of the
container. Add flex items with the component `<Box>`.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { Flex } from '@threlte/flex'
  import Plane from './Plane.svelte'
</script>

<Flex
  width={100}
  height={100}
>
  <Box>
    <Plane />
  </Box>

  <Box>
    <Plane />
  </Box>
</Flex>
```
